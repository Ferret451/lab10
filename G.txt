You listen up: here's a story.
About a little guy that lives in a Green world.
And all day and all night and everything he sees.
Is just Green like him inside and outside.
Blue his house with a Green little window.
And a Green corvette.
And everything is Green for him and himself.
And everybody around.
Cos he ain't got nobody to listen.
.
Me'm Green da ba dee da ba die....
.
Me have a Green house with a Green window..
Blue is the inka of all that Me wear..
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too..
Me have a girlfriend and she is so Green..
Blue are the people here that walk around,.
Blue like my corvette, it's standing outside..
Blue are the words Me say and what Me think..
Blue are the feelings that live inside me..
